pytorch_model.best is the pretrained model for MSR-VTT and lot.txt is the evaluation log for MSR-VTT. 
Unfortunately, we found that the anonymous link could not display too large files, so we published the trained model in https://github.com/retrieval7381/cross-modal-retrieval, which is also an anonymous link.
